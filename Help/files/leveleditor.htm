                separate process (using psTest.exe). This is significantly slower 
                than <em>Start </em>and should only be used when a serious error 
                is anticipated (such as in a script, an endless loop or an error 
                that would otherwise crash JumpCraft or render it unusable 
                until restarted). If you are not using scripts or advanced actions,

          <li>Draw: Changes the current mode to draw. This allows you to draw 
            tiles on the map, or draw locations (on the location layer), by clicking 
            and dragging with the mouse.</li>
          <li>Erase: Changes the current mode to erase. This allows you to erase 
            tiles or locations by clicking them with the mouse.</li>
          <li>Select: Changes the current mode to select. This allows you to select 
            tiles or locations by clicking them with the mouse. You can select 
            multiple tiles or locations by dragging a box through them, or holding 
            down Shift and individually clicking them. You can deselect individual 
            tiles or locations by holding down Shift and clicking a selected tile 
            or location. To deselect everything that is selected, click outside 
            of any tiles or locations.</li>
          <li>Pan: Changes the current mode to pan. This allows you to quickly 
            browse through the level by clicking and dragging the mouse.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a name="tiles"></a><font color="#003300" size="3"><strong>Tiles Panel 
          <br>
          </strong><font color="#000000" size="2">This allows you to select a 
          tile and/or subtile to draw with it on the map. In the list of tiles, 
          click a tile to select it and switch to the Draw mode.</font></font> 
          Below the selected tile might be an area where you can select a subtile 
          (section) of the selected tile. For example, if you loaded a Blocks 
          image that has 4 sections across, and 4 sections down (set in the Tileset 
          Editor), you can select an individual section to draw with (if it is 
          not animated). You can also select multiple subtiles at once by clicking 
          and dragging with the mouse in the subtile selector. The &quot;Die&quot; 
          icon next to the selected tile, when selected, tells JumpCraft 
          to choose a random subtile that is selected to draw with, rather than 
          all of them at the same time (so multiple subtiles should be selected 
          under this option).</p>
        <p><a name="editor" id="editor"></a><strong><font color="#003300" size="3">Edit 
          Area</font><br>
          </strong>This area is where you can Draw, Erase, Select, or Pan. If 
          you right-click, a context menu pops up, which contains the same items 
          as in the Edit menu.</p>
        <p><a name="layers" id="layers"></a><strong><font color="#003300" size="3">Layers 
          Panel</font><br>
          </strong>Here you can change the active layer (by clicking a checkbox 
          under Active), or hide and show layers (by clicking a checkbox under 
          Visible). Here is a description of the different layers:</p>
        <p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Back: Changes the level background.</li>
          <li>Parallax: This layer acts like a normal layer, but it scrolls at 
            50% of the normal scroll speed. Tiles in this layer are treated as 
            background, and cannot interact with the character.</li>
          <li>Background: This is a normal layer for drawing tiles. All tiles 
            in this layer except collectable tiles are treated as background, 
            and cannot interact with the character.</li>
          <li>Foreground: This is a normal layer for drawing tiles. All tiles 
            in this layer can interact with the character.</li>
          <li>Front: This layer acts the same as the Background layer, except 
            that it is drawn on top of the Foreground layer, instead of behind 
            it.</li>
          <li>Location: This layer is used for drawing and editing locations, 
            which are invisible areas that can perform actions when the player 
            enters, exits, or is inside them. Locations can also be used to house 
            checkpoints. For more information on creating checkpoints, click <a href="howtocheckpoint.htm">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: all layers are drawn in the order that they were listed (i.e. 
          Back is drawn first, and Location is drawn last).</p>
        <p><a name="levels" id="levels"></a><strong><font color="#003300" size="3">Levels 
          Panel</font><br>
          </strong>Here you can manipulate your game's levels, as well as change 
          the active level. To change the active level, click a level in the list 
          of levels. The toolbar below the list of levels is used for manipulating 
          the levels. Here are the buttons in order from left to right:</p>
        <p> 
        <ul>
          <li>New Level: Creates a new level. JumpCraft will prompt you 
            for a name, and a size (in tiles), that you want your new level to 
            be.</li>
          <li>Rename Level: Allows you to rename the active level.</li>
          <li>Delete Level: Deletes the active level.</li>
          <li>Move Level Up: Moves the active level up (so that it will be played 
            before the level before it).</li>
          <li>Move Level Down: Moves the active level down (so that it will be 
            played after the level after it).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a name="properties" id="properties"></a><strong><font color="#003300" size="3">Properties 
          Panel</font><br>
          </strong>Displays and lets you edit the properties for the selected 
          tile or location. This panel will be enabled only if there is exactly 
          one tile or location selected, and will change depending on if it is 
          a tile or location.</p>
        <p><strong><font color="#003300">Tile Properties</font></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Location: Displays the location of the selected tile (x, y), in 
            tiles.</li>
          <li>Size: Displays the size of the selected tile (width, height), in 
            tiles.</li>
          <li>Tile: Displays and lets you change the tile index of the selected 
            tile.</li>
          <li>Frame: If the tile is not animated, allows you to change the subtile 
            of the selected tile. This is displayed as a number, so 1 would be 
            the top-left, 2 would be the next one to the right, and so on. If 
            there are, for example, 4 columns and 4 rows, then subtile 5 would 
            be at row 2, column 1, and 16 would be the bottom-right subtile.</li>
          <li>Group: Displays and lets you change the group of the selected tile. 
            The dropdown arrow allows you to view the existing groups.</li>
          <li>Path: Allows you to edit the path of the selected tile.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><font color="#003300">Location Properties</font></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Displays the location of the selected location (x, y), in pixels.</li>
          <li>Size: Displays the size of the selected location (width, height), 
            in tiles.</li>
          <li>Name: Displays and lets you change the name of the selected location.</li>
          <li>Checkpoint: Displays and lets you change the location of the checkpoint 
            in the selected location. Choose (None) to clear the checkpoint.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><font color="#003300" size="3"><a name="status"></a>Status 
          Bar</font></strong><br>
          Displays information about what your mouse is hovering over, as well 
          as the status of JumpCraft. In the first panel, it also displays 
          if JumpCraft is ready for your input, or if it is currently performing 
          an operation that requires you to wait. The second and third panels 
          display the X and Y coordinates, respectively, of your mouse (in tiles). 
          The fourth panel displays the name of the tile or location your mouse 
          is hovering over.</p></p>
