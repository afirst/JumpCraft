## Requirements
This requires the .NET Framework 2.0. It can be installed on Windows 10 when you initially open the solution in Visual Studio. Do not upgrade the projects to the latest .NET Framework (4.x or higher) as the DirectX library is incompatible and will not work.

This project is compatible with the latest versions of Visual Studio and Windows.

## Instructions
Open `Platform Studio.sln` in Visual Studio, set the starting project to `Platform Studio Professional Edition`, and run!

You may see a LoaderLock exception when the application runs. You may simply ignore future exceptions of this type and continue.

The compiled setup files are in the Setup/ directory. Install the professional edition by running jcpro_setup.exe.
